   <h3> <p class="text2"> I started off with a small sewing machine and that allowed me to complete small tasks such as altering shirts and pants. This made some room to improve on my work and realize small mistakes since the sewing machine I was working on was relatively small. I have been working on larger sewing machines since I was 7 and worked alongside my aunts for fun since my whole family knows how to sew. </p></h3> 
    <h3> The more advanced you get, you begin to take orders for clothing. one day youll even be up to the standard of making prom and wedding dresses which is where I would love to be in due time. </h3>
